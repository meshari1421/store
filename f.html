        My dearest latof,
        Happy 3-year anniversary! It's hard to believe it's been
        three whole years since we first met. You've brought so
        much joy, love, and happiness into my life, and I'm so grateful
        to have you by my side. Here's to many more years of laughter,
        adventures, and making unforgettable memories together.
        I love you to the moon and back.
      </p>
